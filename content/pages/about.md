I'm a creative problem solver with a background in building products that people love.

My career spans engineering, design, and product development across startups and established companies. I enjoy the intersection of technical craft, user experience, and strategic thinking.

I started as a self-taught developer, which gave me a deep appreciation for both the technical challenges and creative opportunities in building software. Over time, I've worn many hats — from individual contributor to team lead to product strategist.

What drives me is the opportunity to create products that solve real problems and the chance to help teams do their best work. I believe great products come from great collaboration, clear thinking, and a willingness to iterate.

## What I Do Now

Today, I focus on [building things](/projects), [sharing knowledge](/writings), and helping others navigate their own creative journeys.

When I'm not working, you'll find me exploring new technologies, reading, or enjoying time with family.
